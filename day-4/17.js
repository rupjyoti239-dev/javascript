/**
 Print the factorial of a number n.
[Factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a
given positive integer and denoted by that integer. ]
Example :
7! (factorial of 7) = 1x2x3x4x5x6x7 = 5040
5! (factorial of 5) = 1x2x3x4x5 = 120
3! (factorial of 3) = 1x2x3 = 6
0! Is always
